 Lab 01: Song Library
 
 P.S. This is a README file automatically created by my GitHub Desktop app
 
 P.S.2 I encountered an error I can't solve when I used the command terminal
 to upload the repo here. Hence, I first uploaded the repo into github using my
 personal git account 'Washington99', then I just imported the repo in my github
 into here via the 'new project'->'import project'->'git Repo by url' commands.
 So, the repo here might look different than if it was uploaded via command
 line. Do let me know if there's a problem with the solution I made :>
